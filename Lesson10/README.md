## Zombies and Cats

To start with, take a look at [this page](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/08/11/recursion-explained-with-the-flood-fill-algorithm-and-zombies-and-cats/), which has a great illustration of recursion using zombies and cats. Read up to the **"The Basics: Recursive Calls and Base Cases"** part, then **come back here**. (Feel free to read further if you're curious, but we may end up double-explaining some parts.)

![](https://inventwithpython.com/blogstatic/floodfill/zombie1.gif)

So, we just got... a weird example involving zombies and cats that somehow has to do with recursion. *How?*, you might ask? We'll get to that in a bit, but first, let's define a few things.

## What is recursion?

Simply put, recursion is when a **function calls itself**. One example they gave later on the website was:

    def foo():
        foo()

**So what does this do?**

Feel free to copy this code and try running it to see what happens. If you read further in the earlier link or tried that yourself, you should know that you'll get an error like this:

    RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

This means that we got into something like an **infinite loop** and the `foo` function never stopped calling itself, causing the error you saw.

> An [infinite loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop) is a common thing in computer science where your program ends up hypothetically getting stuck where it will run **forever** if you don't stop it. Normally, this will either cause a crash or you'll have to exit out of the program manually when this happens.

What do you think would happen if we did something like this?

     def foo():
        print("hi.")
        foo()

If you guessed that it would print out "hi" forever, you're right. But if you try running this code, you'll actually get this error again:

    RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

> If you can't see the "hi's", they're there - you just have to scroll up a while because the error message will have a long trail of listing what function it crashed in, which in this case involves a lot of calls of the same function.

That's because the program crashes from the infinite loop after printing "hi" many times.

How about this one?

    def count(num):
        print(num)
        count(num + 1)

Similar story here. It prints out numbers starting from wherever you started, then keeps counting up until it crashes.

## Getting unstuck

About now, you might be wondering how recursion is useful if all we'll ever do is get stuck in an infinite loop. That's where the **base case** comes in.

To illustrate this, let's think back to the cat from the zombie example:

![](cat_transparent.png)

If there were no cats and infinite humans, what would happen? Zombies would keep spreading forever. The cats stop the zombies from spreading.

**The base case is the condition that causes the function to stop making recursive calls.**

To illustrate this, let's look at some more examples:

    def count_to_100(num):
        if num > 100:
            print("all done!")
        else:
            print(num)
            count_to_100(num + 1)

This code is actually very similar to the last snippet we looked at. the main difference is the fact that we have a **base case**. If you run the code like this:

    count_to_100(1)

If you didn't already guess, we would get output like this:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
    ...
    90
    91
    92
    93
    94
    95
    96
    97
    98
    99
    100
    all done!

In this case, the base case is when `num` is greater than 100, which is what allows the code to stop once it hits 100 instead of getting stuck in another infinite loop.

In the zombies and cats example, the base case is when an infected zombie bites a cat - nothing happens. The recursive case is when an infected zombie bites an uninfected human, and that human becomes a zombie.

## Let's try it.

Let's try a similar version of this. Find this function in exercises.py:

    # Recursively count down from num to 1
    def count_down(num):
        # TODO: implement this!
        pass

Here, we're going to want to write a recursive function to count down from whatever number we supply down to 1, then print: "all done!"

For example:

    count_down(10)

should output:

    10
    9
    8
    7
    6
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    all done!

and
    
    count_down(4)

should output

    4
    3
    2
    1
    all done!
    
**I know it's really easy to do this using a while loop or for loop**. For the sake of this problem, see if you can do it with recursion.

> Hint: the code will be pretty similar to the previous coding problem we showed.

## We have to go deeper.

![](lego.gif)

After all of this, you might still be wondering why recursion is actually useful. Broadly speaking, recursion is a powerful tool for us to use whenever problems are structured where each level of the problem can be broken into a smaller version of the original problem.

To illustrate this, let's think of if we wanted to find the sum of the sequence of numbers counting up to 10.

So:

    sum_to_10(5) = 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 45

or

    sum_to_10(6) = 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 40

or

    sum_to_10(10) = 10

We can see a pattern emerging where:

    sum_to_10(5) = 5 + sum_to_10(6)

or in general:

    sum_to_10(n) = n + sum_to_10(n + 1)

Here, we can see the repeating pattern of each step of this equation having another smaller version of the same equation inside of it.

If we were to code this up using recursion, it would look something like this:

    def sum_to_10(num):
        if num == 10:
            return 10
        else:
            return num + sum_to_10(num + 1)

It might be a bit confusing how this is working on first glance. Try sketching out each function call if you're confused and go through it with a mentor until you have a good grasp on that.

## Factorials

Once you've done that, we're going to try to code another similar problem. If you've heard of factorials in math before, this is the way they work:

    5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120

or

    4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24

or 

    0! = 1! = 1

You might notice some similarities to the previous problem (hint hint). Find this part of the code in `exercises.py`:

    # Recursively compute a factorial
    def factorial(num):
        # TODO: implement this!
        return -1

and implement the **recursive** version of factorial. 

> Once again, I know this could be done with a for loop or a while loop, but for the sake of this exercises, let's do it with recursion.

> **Hint**: similar to the previous problem, notice that `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)`.

## Back to the Zombies

About now you might still not be convinced that recursion is useful. The main reason being that every problem we've solved so far could've been solved **more easily** without even using recursion in the first place.

For example, we could have easily done this for count_down:

    def count_down(num):
        cur_num = num
        while cur_num > 0:
            print(cur_num)
            cur_num -= 1
        print("all done!)

Or this for factorial:

    def factorial(num):
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, num + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

> Note: `range(1, num + 1)` returns `[1, 2, 3, ... num]`.

If you thought that both of these solutions would have run just as quickly as the recursive solutions, and they would've been less confusing to code, you're right! The main purpose of us coding them recursively was just as a learning exercise. But then, *when is recursion actually useful?*

### Zombie Algorithm with Recursion

Rather than try to answer that question with just an explanation, I'll give an example.

Let's go back to that zombie example we opened with.

![](https://inventwithpython.com/blogstatic/floodfill/zombie1.gif)

And this time, let's imagine what the code would look like if we were to simulate this happening **using code**.

> Warning: this part is pretty tricky, but **very important** - so do take the time to go through it with a mentor if possible until you really understand it.

First, how would we represent the problem in the first place? How would we keep track of what spaces have zombies, humans, or cats? 

The easiest way would probably be a **two-dimensional array**. In other words, a **list of lists**. This means to access the top left person (that eventually turns into a zombie) in the above picture, we could use `world[0][0]` (where `world` is our 2D array that holds all the humans, zombies, and cats.)

Likewise, to get the topmost left cat, we would use `world[2][1]`.

Just to make this example easier, let's pretend turning one of these spaces into a zombie could be done simply by saying:

    word[6][6] = ZOMBIE

So what would the code look like for this algorithm?

You can solve this problem iteratively, but the code will be somewhat complicated. The recursive solution is much simpler.

### The base case

To figure out what the recursive solution would look like, first figure out what the base case should be. In other words, at what points does the recursion (in this case, more humans turning into zombies) stop?

The answer to this would be when you run into another zombie (it's already a zombie) or when you run into a cat.

If we know this, then we can start writing our recursive function like this:

    def flood_fill(world, x, y):
        if world[x][y] is ZOMBIE or world[x][y] is CAT:
            return

> Here we're assuming that x and y are the coordinates of the human that was just bitten.

### Turning the human into a zombie

Now we know that if the computer reaches the next point in the code, then the being at (x, y) is a human. Since it was just bitten, we should turn it into a zombie!

    def flood_fill(world, x, y):
        if world[x][y] is ZOMBIE or world[x][y] is CAT:
            return
        world[x][y] = ZOMBIE

### Recursive zombie bites

Now, the hard part. What does the recursive call look like? How do we make sure that the zombies spread as far as they should?

We know that the code we already wrote takes care of checking if the being is a human, and biting it if so. All we need to do is *run the same code on the beings next to it*.

What would happen if we did this?

    def flood_fill(world, x, y):
        if world[x][y] is ZOMBIE or world[x][y] is CAT:
            return
        world[x][y] = ZOMBIE
        flood_fill(world, x, y + 1)

Try to take some time to think this out before reading on. What would happen?

This would cause the zombie outbreak to spread vertically downwards (remember, +y is down) from the original zombie until we reached another existing zombie or a cat.

This is because each time a human was turned into a zombie, a recursive call would be made, calling `flood_fill` on the human below, and repeating until we reached another zombie or a cat.

> If you're not sure why this is, take some time to sketch it out and talk it over with a mentor until you get it - this part is really important to get before moving on.

But the zombies need to be spreading in other directions too, not just down.

### Multidirectional zombie bites

What would happen if we changed the code to do this?

    def flood_fill(world, x, y):
        if world[x][y] is ZOMBIE or world[x][y] is CAT:
            return
        world[x][y] = ZOMBIE
        flood_fill(world, x, y + 1)
        flood_fill(world, x + 1, y)

Again, talk it over with a mentor until you understand what's going on here. 

### You try!

Once you get that, go ahead and complete the rest of the missing code in exercises.py.

> Don't worry about going out of bounds on the `world` 2-D array. We already wrote a check for you that makes `flood_fill` do nothing if (x, y) is out of bounds.

Once you get that and check it with a mentor, congrats! You made it! We've just successfully coded a full zombie outbreak :)

If you still don't feel like you understand recursion very well, it's fine - we'll have plenty of time to practice in [Lesson 11](../Lesson11).

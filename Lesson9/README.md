# Lesson 9: More advanced algorithms

**To start this lesson, students should:**

* Understand the basics of lists and dicts in Python.
* Have a decent amount of experience analyzing and coding semi-complex algorithms.

**By completing this lesson, students will:**

* Gain more practice with using data structures.
* Practice decomposing complex functions into smaller, simpler functions.

Learning to code is like learning to play an instrument - it's all about practice and repetition. This lesson contains a few more practice problems to reinforce what you've learned.

## 1. round_sum

The first question is on CodingBat. Do to the question [here](http://codingbat.com/prob/p179960), then return here afterward for the other questions - they will all be in exercises.py.

## 2. Find last letters

The next exercise is in exercises.py. Find this code in the file:

	# 2. Find last letters
	
	def find_last_letters(word):
	  result = {}
	  # TODO
	  return ret

Write code that takes a word and returns a dictionary of the position of the last occurrence of each letter. 

For example, given the word 'challenge', it would return the dictionary `{'c': 0, 'h': 1, 'a': 2, 'l': 4, 'e': 8, 'n': 6, 'g': 7}` (remember, the first letter is at position 0).

## 3. Words by length

### Part 1:

Find this part of the code in part 3:

	def words_by_length(words):
	  result = {}
	  # TODO
	  return result

Write this function so that it takes a list of words and separates them into a dict that arranges them by length, mapping each length to a list of words that are that length.

For example, given the list `['cat', 'dog', 'bird', 'sheep', 'rat', 'horse', 'human', 'lion']`, your function should return:

	{
	  3: ['cat', 'dog', 'rat'],
	  4: ['bird', 'lion'],
	  5: ['sheep', 'horse', 'human'],
	}
	
### Part 2:

Now, in this part of the code:

	def word_appears(words_dict, word):
	  # TODO
	  return False

Write another function that takes this dictionary as the parameter, `word_dict` and a word and returns True if the word appears anywhere in the dictionary.

### Challenge:

What happens if a word appears more than once in the input list? 

In this part of the code:

	def words_by_length_challenge(words):
	  result = {}
	  # TODO
	  return result

Write a different version of your function so that each word appears only once in the dictionary that you return.

## 4. Nested lists

This is a two-part question.

### Part A: Splitting lists

In this part of the code:

	def split_list(items, count):
	  result = []
	  # TODO
	  return result

Write a function that takes a list, `items`, and a number and breaks the list into a list of lists of the given size. 

The last sub-list can be shorter if there aren't enough items to fill it up. For example:

	split_list([1, 3, 5, 7], 2) -> [[1, 3], [5, 7]]
	split_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], 3) -> [[1, 3, 5], [7, 9, 11], [13]]
	split_list([1, 3, 5, 7], 10) -> [[1, 3, 5, 7]]
	split_list([], 3) -> []

(`split_list` always returns a list containing other lists, unless the input list is empty.)

### Challenge: 

In this function:

	def split_list_challenge(items, count):
	  result = []
	  # TODO
	  return result

Try rewriting the function using slices instead. [This StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/509295) explains what slices are and how to use them.

**Note**: It's possible to write this function in a single line using a *list comprehension*, a shorthand for loops that generate lists. It's not part of this lesson, but if you're curious, you can read about list comprehensions [here](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python).

### Part B: Finding items in nested lists

In this function:

	def which_list(lists, item):
	  # TODO
	  return -1

Write code that finds which sublist a given item is in. If the item is in multiple sublists, return the index of the first one that it appears in. If the item isn't in any of the lists, return -1. For example:

	which_list([[1, 3, 5], [5, 7, 9], [9, 11]], 1) -> 0
	which_list([[1, 3, 5], [5, 7, 9], [9, 11]], 5) -> 0
	which_list([[1, 3, 5], [5, 7, 9], [9, 11]], 9) -> 1
	which_list([[1, 3, 5], [5, 7, 9], [9, 11]], 11) -> 2
	which_list([[1, 3, 5], [5, 7, 9], [9, 11]], 17) -> -1

> **Hint**: You can use `for item_index, item in enumerate(list)` to loop over list items along with their indexes, so `item_index` would equal the list index, and `item` would be the actual item at that index.

### Runtime

What's the Big O runtime of the function in part A? What about part B? Check with a mentor to see if you're right.

Challenge: Can you make part B faster if you make part A return something else? (Don't worry if you can't figure out a way to do this - it's pretty difficult! Feel free to brainstorm ideas with mentors and people around you.)

We're all done here - on to [lesson 10](../Lesson10)!
